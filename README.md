# Typing Speed & Accuracy Test
This is a simple Python project that helps users measure their typing speed and accuracy. It randomly selects a paragraph and asks the user to type it exactly as shown. The program then calculates:

Typing Speed (WPM): Words per minute based on time taken.
Accuracy: Percentage of correctly typed words.
Errors: Number of incorrect words.
It uses Pythonâ€™s time and random modules to track time and select paragraphs dynamically. This project is useful for improving typing skills and analyzing performance.
